# data-visualisation
I'm currently working on this project


Description:
The Data Visualization Dashboard project is a comprehensive data visualization solution that leverages a variety of modern technologies to transform raw data into insightful, interactive, and visually appealing charts and graphs. This project aims to provide users with a user-friendly interface to explore and understand the data in Data.csv. Here are the key components and technical skills used:

1. Database Setup:
Data from the provided Data.csv file is imported into a database. where I've used PostgreSQL.

3. Backend:
The backend of the project is implemented using Java and Spring Boot. Spring Boot provides a robust framework for creating RESTful APIs and handling database interactions.

4. Frontend:
The user interface is designed using a modern JavaScript library React.js. These frameworks offer flexibility and scalability to build a dynamic and interactive frontend.

6. Data Visualization:
To create engaging visualizations, I've used data visualization libraries D3.js These libraries allow us to build a wide variety of charts, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and more
